# ProceduralMCSkin
Procedurally generated MC skins using a shader-style renderer.

### setup
- `git clone https://github.com/wntiv-main/ProceduralMCSkin.git`
- use server (ye ik but you need it for js modules to work i think), i recommend [Five Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server)
- run and it works
- edit `js/index.js` to change the skin

### questions
its very slow bcuz its javascript and i have like no optimisations and i cant be bothered and if u want fast DO IT URSELF. this was enough for me and the skins i made so cope.
